	<h2>About the project</h2>
  
	<h3> Project Concept </h3>
	<p>
		In this project, we create various charts and displays for analyzing the flight delays in domestic 
		flights in January 2019. Using a geographical map and other chart types, a business traveler can quickly identify 
		which airports have the highest or lowest delay rate and which day of the week has the highest or 
		the lowest rate of delay. Then, he can use this information to adjust his travel plan accordingly. 
		Similarly, an airline executive can apply this knowledge to change the business plan to increase 
		profits and improve customer satisfaction.

	<h3> Individual Contribution </h3>
	<p> 
		Since we are working on a small dataset, our team collaborates closely on major design decisions. Each team member 
		contributes to every aspect of the project - design, EDA, data integration, website construction, tableau implementation,
		presentation, and testing. We communicate by slack channel and provide constructive feedback regularly. As a result, we agree that 
		we share equal credits on all tasks. 
	</p>
	
	<h3> Intended Audience </h3>	
		<ul>
			<li>Airline Executive</li>
			<li>Business Traveler</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h3> Project Goals </h3>
		<p>
		In this project, we aim to create some useful visualization to help the two intended audiences to answer the following questions.
		</p>
		<p> As an airline executive, you would like to:
		<ul>
			<li> Understand which flights have the highest and lowest rate of delay
			<li> Identify the airports with the highest or lowest rate of delay
			<li> Determine which day of the week has the highest or lowest rate of delay
			<li> Compare which time blocks of a day has the lowest or highest rate of delay
			<li> Compare the rate of delay between different flight distance
			<li> Compare a particular airline's delay with other airlines by the airport, day of the week, and time of the day.
		</ul>

		<p> As a business traveler, you plan a trip by plane. You want to understand the possible delays at various times
		days of the week, airlines, and airports to arrange the trip accordingly. </p>
		<ul>
			<li> Identify which airline has the lowest rate of delay
			<li> Determine which airline has the lowest rate of delay for a particular route
			<li> Compare which day of the week has the highest or lowest rate of delay
			<li> Compare which time blocks of a day has the lowest or highest rate of delay
			<li> Discover which airport has the lowest rate of delay in a metropolitan area
		</ul>
	
	
	<h3> Data Sources </h3>	
		<ul>
			<li> Kaggle's Flight delay data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divyansh22/flight-delay-prediction) This data 
			is collected from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Govt. of the USA. This data is open-sourced under 
			U.S. Govt. Works. This dataset contains all the flights in the month of January 2019. There are more than 
			580,000 flights in the month of January itself throughout the United States.
			
			<li> Airport data (https://vega.github.io/vega-tutorials/airports). This data set contains a list of U.S. 
			airports in CSV (comma-separated value) format. The first column (IATA) contains a unique identifier provided 
			by the International Air Transport Association. Subsequent columns describe the name and location of the airport, 
			including latitude and longitude coordinates. 
			
			<li> Airline mapping (https://www.kaggle.com/code/miquar/explore-flights-csv-airports-csv-airlines-csv/data). 
			It contains the mapping of IATA airline codes and names.

			<li> Metropolitan Airport data. 
			We use the metropolitan area airport code from the website (https://wikitravel.org/en/Metropolitan_Area_Airport_Codes)
			to compose a CSV to supplement the website.
		
		</ul>
		
	
	<h3> Future Improvement </h3>
		<h4>Additional data</h4>
		<p>
		We cannot add climate change data due to the selection of time constraints, computation constraints, and base data set. 
		Initially, we selected the Jan 2019 flight delay data from Kaggle as our base dataset. However, since it has a short 
		time series component (31 days), adding climate change does not add too much value. If we have more time and resources 
		(over 10 million domestic flights annually), we should consider choosing a different base data set and include additional data.
		</p>

		<h4>Further Analysis of the results</h4>
		<p>
		Some anecdotal evidence based on informal observation of hotel room rates and plane ticket prices shows that Friday 
		is usually the busiest day to travel. The possible reasons include business travelers attending a weeklong meeting 
		and returning home on Friday. In addition, leisure travelers leave on Friday for a weekend getaway. As a result, 
		I hypothesize that Friday has the highest air traffic, which causes the highest probability of flight delay. 
		</p>
		<p>
		However, our data visualization charts reveal that Thursday has the highest air traffic and also the highest number 
		of delays. The result is counterintuitive. If we have more time, we would like to research and include more data 
		for further investigation. 
		</p>
		<p>
		We also hypothesize that a busy airport causes a higher probability of flight delays. Again, however, our charts show 
		inconclusive results. For example, Atlanta airport is the busiest airport, but it has only an average flight delay 
		percentage of 13%. On the other hand, although New York LaGuardia airport has only 14K flights, about half of the 
		number of flights in Atlanta airport, LaGuardia's flight delay percentage is 28%, twice as large as Atlanta airport 
		(13%). One possible reason is the difference in weather conditions between the airports. It is another compelling 
		reason to explore additional data for investigation. 
		</p>


		<h4> Iterative Development Process </h4>
		<p>
		We found that the usability studies are extremely valuable. Therefore, we suggest we improve our project development 
		process by incorporating multiple rounds of usability testing and improving our data visualization iteratively. So 
		we must formalize and standardize the usability results. For example, we want to measure our subjects' task time, 
		success rate, and error rate quantitatively. Qualitatively, we want to record data related to ease of use, problems 
		experienced, and answers to open-ended questions.
