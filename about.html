	</h3>
	<p class="c0">
		<span class="c3">In this project, we create various visualizations for analyzing US domestic flight delays in January 2019. Using a geographical map and other charts, business travelers can quickly identify which airports or day of the week have the highest or lowest delay rate. Then, they can use this information to adjust their travel plans accordingly. Similarly, an airline executive can apply this knowledge to change the business plan to optimize profits and customer satisfaction.</span>

		<span class="c1">Data Sources</span>
	</h3>
	<ul class="c10 lst-kix_16rpgpwcl5lv-0 start">
		<li class="c0 c5 li-bullet-0">
			<span class="c3">Kaggle&#39;s Flight delay data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/divyansh22/flight-delay-prediction) This data is collected from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Govt. of the USA. This data is open-sourced under U.S. Govt. Works. This dataset contains all the flights in the month of January 2019. There are more than 580,000 flights in the month of January itself throughout the United States.</span>
		</li>
		<li class="c0 c5 li-bullet-0">
			<span class="c3">Airport data (https://vega.github.io/vega-tutorials/airports). This data set contains a list of U.S. airports in CSV (comma-separated value) format. The first column (IATA) contains a unique identifier provided by the International Air Transport Association. Subsequent columns describe the name and location of the airport, including latitude and longitude coordinates.</span>
		</li>
		<li class="c0 c5 li-bullet-0">
			<span class="c3">Airline mapping (https://www.kaggle.com/code/miquar/explore-flights-csv-airports-csv-airlines-csv/data). It contains the mapping of IATA airline codes and names.</span>
		</li>
		<li class="c0 c5 li-bullet-0">
			<span class="c3">Metropolitan Airport data. We use the metropolitan area airport code from the website (https://wikitravel.org/en/Metropolitan_Area_Airport_Codes) to compose a CSV to supplement the website.</span>
		</li>

		<span class="c1">Future Improvement</span>

	<h4 class="c6" id="h.8swen4uh0aqa">
		<span class="c7">Additional data</span>
	</h4>
	<p class="c0">
		<span class="c3">We cannot add climate change data due to the selection of time constraints, computation constraints, and base data set. Initially, we selected the Jan 2019 flight delay data from Kaggle as our base dataset. However, since it has a short time series component (31 days), adding climate change does not add too much value. If we have more time and resources (over 10 million domestic flights annually), we should consider choosing a different base data set and include additional data.</span>
	</p>
	<h4 class="c6" id="h.sjj2vfmi9e4a">
		<span class="c7">Further Analysis of the results</span>
	</h4>
	<p class="c0">
		<span class="c3">Some anecdotal evidence based on informal observation of hotel room rates and plane ticket prices shows that Friday is usually the busiest day to travel. The possible reasons include business travelers attending a weeklong meeting and returning home on Friday. In addition, leisure travelers leave on Friday for a weekend getaway. As a result, I hypothesize that Friday has the highest air traffic, which causes the highest probability of flight delay.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c0">
		<span class="c3">However, our data visualization charts reveal that Thursday has the highest air traffic and also the highest number of delays. The result is counterintuitive. If we have more time, we would like to research and include more data for further investigation.</span>
	</p>
	<p class="c0">
		<span class="c3">We also hypothesize that a busy airport causes a higher probability of flight delays. Again, however, our charts show inconclusive results. For example, Atlanta airport is the busiest airport, but it has only an average flight delay percentage of 13%. On the other hand, although New York LaGuardia airport has only 14K flights, about half of the number of flights in Atlanta airport, LaGuardia&#39;s flight delay percentage is 28%, twice as large as Atlanta airport (13%). One possible reason is the difference in weather conditions between the airports. As a result, it is compelling to explore additional data to determine the actual reasons.</span>
	</p>
	<h4 class="c6" id="h.q48j3limg9lj">
		<span class="c7">Iterative Development Process</span>
	</h4>
	<p class="c0">
		<span class="c3">We found that the usability studies are extremely valuable. Therefore, &nbsp;if time allows, we suggest we improve the project development process by incorporating multiple rounds of usability testing and enhancing our data visualization iteratively. Furthermore, we must standardize the usability studies by recording quantitative and qualitative results. For example, we want to quantitatively measure our subjects&#39; task time, success rate, and error rate. Similarly, we want to record qualitative data related to ease of use, problems experienced, and answers to open-ended questions.</span>
